It's a project of ≈Åukasz Makinia, a very good programmer, very good for coding training.
I made 5 patches for it

1. Ability to create a fake data for testing
2. Improved loading of csv files
3. Possibility to add a new product from the user level of the program
4. Fix view customers graph without data
5. Added ability to automatic tranlate application to polisish language
   (To translate app for polish language use: python manage.py compilemessages, on windows you need https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/i18n/translation/#gettext-on-windows  to properly work
